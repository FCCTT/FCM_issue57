######Compiled by Gord Campbell

If you have Ubuntu-related questions, email them to: questions@fullcirclemagazine.org, and Gord will answer them in a future issue. Please include as much information as you can about your problem.

如果你有Ubuntu相关问题，可以发邮件至questions@fullcirclemagazine.org，Gord会在后面发布的杂志中回答你的问题。请在问题中包含尽可能多的问题描述。

#####Q How can I uninstall a program?

A Go to the software centre, search for the name of the application, select it, and click the "uninstall" button.


#####Q How can I install iplist (aka IpBlock) in 11.10.

A Use pgl instead, the successor of moblock/blockcontrol/mobloquer. http://sourceforge.net/projects/peerguardian/


#####Q I have lost my password. How can I log on?

A (Thanks to bcbc in the Ubuntu Forums.) Boot in recovery mode. You might need to select the third option, "Remount read/write". Then select "root shell prompt." It will put you at a command prompt, type:

passwd [userid]

where [userid] is your userid. In my case, it's gord. Enter your new password twice, then it should say your password was updated. Enter the command:

exit

Select "Resume normal boot," and you should be able to use the password you just created.

Those of you concerned about security should note that this method provides anyone (who has physical access to your computer) complete access to all the programs and unencrypted data.


#####Q Will Microsoft Office Professional 2010 work under Wine?

A Yes, with Wine version 1.32. See this for full instructions: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1885051


#####Q Running DVDstyler fails with a segmentation fault in Ubuntu 11.10.

A (Thanks to Rattus Norvegicus in the Ubuntu Forums) It works fine under Gnome Classic.


#####Q Using Ubuntu 11.10, how can I get my Firefox bookmarks over to a new machine? They've taken out the Backup/Restore using a .json file.

A Open "Show All Bookmarks." Now, move your mouse up to the left half of the top panel, and "import and backup" will appear.


#####Q I installed Xubuntu 11.10 on my desktop. In live mode, it showed my hard drive partitions on the desktop as icons, but, once installed, the mounted partitions are not shown on the desktop. Why?

A The LiveCD is run from CD or USB, so hard disk partitions are viewed as external. For a hard disk-based OS, partitions are internal. Only external media appear on the desktop.


#####Q As far as I can make out, Oneiric does not work with Intel GMA500 video?

A Have a look at http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11356431&postcount=4605


#####Q Is Avidemux available in the Ubuntu 11.10 repositories yet? It wasn't when 11.10 was first released.

A (Thanks to linuxman94 in the Ubuntu Forums) Yes, it is. For future reference, you can check what repos packages are in by searching in http://packages.ubuntu.com. Note that you might need to search through all three of oneiric, oneiric-updates, and oneiric-backports.


#####Q I am trying to install Drupal. "sudo apt-get install drupal7" said the package is not found.

A Even the latest version of Ubuntu still has Drupal6 in its repositories, while 7.10 is available at drupal.org.


#####Q I have a hot new system with an MSI Z68A-G45 (UEFI) motherboard and i7-2600k CPU. Several versions of Ubuntu all hang at the same place early on in the boot, just after detecting USB pen drive or USB hid, when booting from CD.

A (Thanks to Trevelyon in the Ubuntu Forums) I used the nomodeset noacpi options and the installation CD comes up. Also had to add them (after installation) to boot from the SSD.


#####Q I downloaded the Ubuntu 10.04.3 32-bit desktop ISO, then used Startup Disk Creator to make a bootable USB stick to install Ubuntu on several other computers. When I boot from it, I get "Boot Error" on a blank black screen.

A Try using Unetbootin to create your USB stick, and if that fails, burn a CD.


#####Q I'm using Ubuntu 11.10. I recently installed gtkpod to upload songs to my classic iPod. When I open gtkpod, it just has a blank screen - the iPod is nowhere to be found. It shows up in the places list and the audacious music player.

A (Thanks to sasasas in the Ubuntu Forums) I installed Amarok. GTKpod would have been nice as it has the ability to remove duplicates.


Tips and Techniques
New Technology, 2012 Edition

New technology always causes disruptions, and UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is no exception. For now, UEFI appears to be replacing or supplementing the BIOS on high-end desktop systems, but you can expect it to spread throughout the industry over the next couple of years. If you're thinking of buying a new computer, you should check on the current state of support for its various features before you buy.

UEFI supports hard drives larger than 2 TB, and brings graphics and the mouse to the power-on interface. It also opens up a lot of potential for the future, which was not possible with the 16-bit, 1 MB limits of the BIOS. The large hard drives use another new technology, GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) Partition Table, or GPT, instead of the old MBR partition table.

The other hot new technology is Solid State "Disks" (SSD), which cause their own disruptions.

The combination led Antti Kirjavainen, who logs on as Ubutuxer, to ask this question in the Ubuntu Forums: "is it possible to get Ubuntu 11.10 or 12.04 to boot from an SSD connected to an Asus P8H61-I motherboard?" Three days later, he posted the solution!

In his first post, Kirjavainen explained that he could boot from a USB stick, and install Ubuntu onto the SSD, but when he booted the installed system it yielded a black screen with a blinking cursor.

Oldfred, Zensov and Robgill commented on the question, then Kirjavainen gave the solution. In his (slightly edited) words:

1) GPT partitioning seemed to be a problem for the Ubuntu installer. I took the SSD out of the PC, plugged it into another PC with a SATA-to-USB adapter, and created a normal partition table on it without any of the non-working GPT crap. I created the partitions as follows (with cfdisk, gparted also works):

1: FAT 32 partition for the EFI bootloader. I set this to 500 MB size and formatted it with mkfs.vfat.
2: / (root) partition (ext4).
3: /home partition (ext4).

I use no swap on computers like this, that have 16 to 32 GB of RAM.

2) I kept the SSD plugged to the other PC with the SATA-to-USB adapter and mounted the boot partition. I created a folder efi/grub under it with the command "mkdir -p efi/grub".

3) Now the disk was ready for installation. I put the SSD back in the new PC, booted up Ubuntu installation from the USB stick and installed it as usual, formatting / and /home as ext4 in the process.

SUCCESS!!!

The PC boots in about 10-15 seconds, as you'd expect from an SSD. The network card on this motherboard works on Ubuntu 11.10 out-of-the-box as well. 10.04 doesn't seem to recognise it, 11.04 I'm not sure.

My advice to others reading Ubuntu's EFI/UEFI instructions:

Do NOT start recompiling Grub or other more complicated stuff. It is completely unnecessary.

The instructions are outdated for 11.10 and just creating the FAT partition with a folder efi/grub is enough for Ubuntu to automatically recognise and install the bootloader there. Ubuntu 11.10 already has a working GRUB for EFI systems, you do NOT need to compile one yourself, at least not for the Asus EZ.

So, in short: create the partitions on a non-EFI system, mkdir 2 folders and install. If I only knew from the start that it was this simple....


After a long career in the computer industry, including a stint as editor of Computing Canada and Computer Dealer News, Gord is now more-or-less retired.
