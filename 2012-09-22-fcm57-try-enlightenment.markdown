Try Enlightenment

Written by Rich Dennis


NOTE: Don’t kernel panic, programmers, Greg will be back with more Python next month.
In the mean time, you can grab Robin's Python Special Edition: Volume 3 from the FCM site. It reprints parts 17 to 21, of Greg's Python series, in one handy PDF.


Enlightenment is one of many desktop environments available for the Linux desktop, and has been featured in many Ubuntu respins. E16, its first incarnation, was released by Carsten Haitzler (Rasterman) in 1997; its newest version, E17, has been in developmnent since 2000. It is a very lightweight, themeable window manager built on a set of libraries (EFL) built to be used in creating flexible interfaces for a wide range of devices, from smartphones to multimonitor desktops. Enlightenment's default configuration is structured around the Engage dock, the iBar application launcher, iBox minimized window holder, analog clock, laptop battery meter, CPU useage monitor, and Pager module that controls switching between virtual desktops. Shelves, analogous to panels in GNOME or XFCE, control the placement of these individual modules on any one of up to 2048 virtual desktops stretched across an 8x8 grid. Enlightenment has gained a following among Linux users because of its beautiful, flexible, lightweight interface. Conversely, during its decade-long development, E17 has never truly left beta status and has earned a reputation for being difficult to configure and prone to crashes and segfaults, which makes remasters featuring it particularly attractive.

One of the first Ubuntu respins to feature Enlightenment as a window manager and desktop environment was OpenGEU (shown above), initially named Geubuntu. Developed in Italy by Luca DiMarini (TheDarkMaster, who wrote for FCM in the early days) in 2007, the respin's name was changed in 2008 to abide by Canonical's restrictions on the use of its trademark – only an officially recognized remix can use Ubuntu in its name.  The first OpenGEU public offering, Luna Crescente, was based on 8.04 Intrepid Ibex; the next two updates, 8.10 Quarto Di Luna and 9.04 Luna Serena were based on the corresponding Ubuntu releases. As of 2011, the future of the distro is uncertain – according to an update on the website in 2010, an updated version of OpenGEU was supposed to be based on Debian Testing. User feedback on the distro was always extremely favorable, since its primary competitor, Elive, was based on Debian and charged a fee to download and install. 

gOS (shown above right), created by Good OS LLC founder Dave Liu in in 2007, was initially offered to the public as "an alternative OS with Google Apps and other Web 2.0 apps for the modern user." Version 1.0.1_386 came preinstalled on the Everex gPC T2502 sold at WalMart. It was based on Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon using E17 for window management and as a desktop environment, and prominently featuring an Apple-inspired interface with Google gadgets in place of the OSX Dashboard. Because of its reliance on Enlightenment, Ajax technology and Web 2.0 apps, a typical gOS system took up very little hard disk space (2 GB) and had very modest hardware requirements (a 1 GhZ processor and 256 MB of RAM). In reviews of the distro, E17 was compared very favorably with other Ubuntu respins which used GNOME or XFCE for its overall lightness, responsiveness, and speed. As of January 2008 Version 2.0.0 beta, codenamed “Rocket”, was offered on Everex's new line of Cloudbook netbooks. Because of problems, the next rewrite of gOS, V2 Rocket, eliminated E17 as a desktop environment and window manager in favor of GNOME, Compiz Fusion and Avant Window Navigator; some Enlightenment code was retained. By version 3, the last to be offered before the website and blog went offline, gOS had become a generic GNU distro, based on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, GNOME, Web 2.0 and Mozilla Prism technolog; E17 had been completely phased out. As of now, gOS Space and gOS 3.1 Gadgets  are available for download from LinuxFreedom, but the website is offline. Forums are still available for users interested in the current possibilities of this now somewhat dated distribution.

OzOS (shown left) is an Xubuntu derivative created by Ruis Pais utilizing the E17 window manager; it features an elegant desktop and minimal suite of applications. With its left-centered vertical implementation of the iBar, ozOS seems to slightly foreshadow GNOME3 – whether that's a good or bad thing is up to the user to decide.  Otherwise, the launchers and iBar take the user to the typical set of XFCE applications – Thunar as file manager, Xfburn and Parole for multimedia, Mozilla Firefox. One of its innovations, apt-foo, which allowed browser-based package installation, was found to be problematic, even after a .deb package apt-url was installed in the usual fashion through Synaptic. The project's web site, http://www.cafelinux.org/OzOs/, is currently inaccessible and not much information is available. On Distrowatch, the distribution's status has been changed from Active to Dormant. 

MoonOS (shown above)is an Ubuntu remaster developed by Chanrithy Thim in Cambodia. Version 2 “Kachana” was initially released February 2009, closely followed in September of the same years with version 3 “Makara”. This update was based on Karmic Koala 9.04, E17 and the Linux 2.6.28 kernel – it was a visually unique respin and its implementation of E17 was highly regarded. It also featured, a la Linux Mint, proprietary tools: moonAssistant, moonControl, moonGrub and moonSoftware. The distrubution is currently active, but the latest version “Neak” has taken a new path, based on GNOME 2.28 and featuring Docky. 

Bodhi Linux (shown right) is the current, modern Ubuntu spin based on E17. Its primary developer, Jeff Hoogland, launched its first alpha on November 16 2010, after he got frustrated reconfiguring E17 on all of his systems. The distro went through four more alpha versions, a beta and four release candidates before Version 1 was released on March 26, 2011. Prominent features of the distro include the use of lightweight apps like the Midori web browser and PCManFM file manager. Currently at v 1.3, lead developer Hoogland's blog details ambitious plans for version 2, planned to follow Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin – 64-bit versions are planned.

Booting into a live session, Bodhi offers seven profiles that the user can choose from, Bare, Compositing, Desktop, Laptop, Fancy, Tablet, Tiling. Each profile is optimized for a certain type of use and a specific user preference – desktop, laptop and tablet obviously tailored to each screen and hardware profile, the others for a user's visual or organizational preference – less is more, or effects and eye-candy enabled. After this, a second screen offers the user a choice of 7 themes. Choosing the Desktop profile and Bodhi-detorious theme brings the user to a spartan but very responsive desktop. The software selection is limited on the disc, but as developer Hoogland says, “All the applications are available from the click of a mouse.” Particularly since one of Bodhi's innovations is a successful implementation of the browser-based software installer previously mentioned in ozOS. Select Install Software from the left-click desktop menu of the Application menu on the bottom shelf, and Midori brings you to Bodhi's website, where software is categorized, previewed and available to Install Now. Currently, Bodhi is a semi-rolling distribution, requiring clean installs only when new Ubuntu LTS versions are released. According to Hoogland, via the website, a dedicated package manager is “in the works”, after which point Bodhi will be a truly rolling distribution requiring no reinstalls.

E17 has a varied history as an Ubuntu desktop environment. In a post of his blog, Thoughts on Technology, Bodhi developer Jeff Hoogland gave it fifth place in the list of commonly known and used Linux DE's – yes it is beautiful, powerful, flexible, but since it's still in beta, be warned, crashes and segfaults can cause headaches. So take on of these remixes and give them a try if you're interested in E17. They're all definitely worth a try.
