## Ubuntu TV

`by Robin Catling`

Canonical has taken the covers off Ubuntu TV, the latest technical product within the Ubuntu brand. Press coverage is synchronised across the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), selected news titles (PCPro among them) and on the Ubuntu website http://www.ubuntu.com/tv.

This is the first public look as Ubuntu TV, which, as Mark Shuttleworth promised, aims to broaden the reach of the Ubuntu open-source operating system beyond the PC - Ubuntu on everything tablets; smart-phones and TVs. Canonical is showing the first Ubuntu TV at CES in Las Vegas with an expectation of the first Ubuntu-powered television on sale by the end of this year. Tellingly, there are no announcements of partners or deals with any brand-name manufacturers in these announcements and Canonical CEO Jane Silber wouldn't name any in talks.

Despite Google's renewed push on Google TV, it could be seen as a direct response to the rumours of Apple lining up a dramatic next generation of Apple TV. Just how Canonical intends to sit between these two tectonic plates, neither of which has a track record of success - yet - appears to rest on confidence; that device manufacturers want an open, neutral platform from a supplier that doesn't profit its' own brand at their expense.

Although movie streaming services will be supported as well as live television broadcasts a major issue is going to be deals for content. In the meanwhile, you can glory in the Ubuntu TV interface, which, as we discussed on the podcast, could well be the killer application for which Unity was destined.

## Air Force Drone Controllers Embrace Linux

"Last year, U.S. military drone control systems were infected with Windows USB worms. They seem to be moving the control systems to Linux now," said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, via Twitter.

As evidence of the apparent shift, he posted pictures of a drone control system from 2009 (the image was originally published by the Air Force), which appears to sport a Windows graphical user interface. For comparison, Hypponen then posted an unclassified slide (above) from a 2010 briefing that details Linux as being part of a 2011 upgrade.

## EPUB / MOBI

Finally we have both epub and mobi formatted Full Circle on the downloads page. At the moment it's only FCM#56 that's online, but we're hoping to have back issues online shortly. If you've any problems with the epub/mobi files/formatting you can drop an email to Jens at: mobile@fullcirclemagazine.org

Big thanks to Jens, Oppih and the beta testers for making them a reality.
