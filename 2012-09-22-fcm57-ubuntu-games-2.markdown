Jamestown: Legend of the Lost Colony is the knockout debut from Final Form Games. This top-down shooter takes what we all know and love from classic shooters and gives it a refresh - with imaginative storytelling and amazing graphics. The solid gameplay is the cherry on top that makes this recent Humble Indie Bundle feature a great addition to any gamer’s collection.

詹姆斯敦：失落殖民地的传说最终是以射击类游戏的形式首次亮相。这种自上而下的射击手带着我们都熟悉和喜爱的经典游戏的特点，以充满想象力的故事和令人惊异的图片使我们眼前一亮。这种游戏的固定方式是在顶端的樱桃，这使得近期的Humble Indie Bundle拥有了玩家收集量的显著增长。

Jamestown takes place in the 17th century as the British battle for survival on colonial Mars. You begin your journey as an escaped convict from the Tower of London en route to the Lost Colony of Roanoke. Your mission is to clear your name by way of heroic deeds, which leads you to the Eastern Frontier - where John Smith helps to defend the colony from the allied Spanish/Martian troops.

詹姆斯敦发生在17世纪英国殖民火星的生存战争。你可以作为一个从伦敦塔到达罗诺克殖民地逃亡的逃犯开始你的旅程，你的任务是通过英雄的事迹来消除你的名字，这将引导你去Eastern Frontier,在那儿John Smith会帮助抵御这些来自西班牙和火星联合部队的殖民者。

There are four ships available - Beam, Gunner, Charge, and Bomber. Your first ship is the basic, yet still capable, Beam. On the keyboard, Z is the main attack and X is the special attack. In this case, a beam can quickly eliminate larger and stronger enemies compared to the standard Z attack. Enemies that are killed drop gold coins - which help fill your vaunt meter, which activates a shield for a short period of time and is quite helpful when there is an incoming barrage of enemies. The vaunt, which is activated by pressing the space bar, also gives you a bonus that boosts that level's star rating.

在这儿可以得到四艘船——Beam,Gunner,Charge和Bomber。你的第一艘船——Beam是最基础的，但是仍然有能力。在键盘上，Z代表主攻，X代表特殊攻击。相比Z的攻击，x的特殊攻击能使一个Beam很快的消灭更大更强的敌人。那些被杀死的敌人会掉下金币，这将帮助填充你的夸米时计，并可以将盾牌激活一段很短的时间并且在敌人射击时很有帮助。这种增强模式，可以用空格键激活，可以给你奖金来加快星级的增长。

After completing a level, there is an in-depth breakdown of your performance such as enemies destroyed and highest combo. After a few stages of battle, you can head to the shop and spend that hard earned gold to unlock items like ships,challenge packs, and various game modes.Overall, the controls and gameplay are very solid and smooth; there were no noticeable glitches or bugs, and the controls were comfortable on both mouse and keyboard.

在完成一个等级后，就会在你执行方面有更细微的划分，例如敌人的摧毁和最高的组合。经过几个阶段的战争后，你可以直接去商店，花费你努力赚来的黄金去解锁项目，比如船、挑战包和各种游戏模型。总的来说，控制操作和游戏的模式都十分固定而且流畅；没有明显的小故障或错误，在鼠标和键盘之间的控制操作是十分舒服的。

The graphics and soundtrack are an integral part of most games, but Final Form did an impeccable job with the quality of the stage design, music, and sound effects. The detail and care put into the lush pixel environments give it a polished look, and Chilean composer Francisco Cerda created a beautiful soundtrack to complement it. These elements are what really set Jamestown apart from other top-down shooters on the market today.

其中图片和声音占整个游戏的一大部分，但是最终的形式的确是一个无瑕疵的工作，包括活动场景设计的质量、音乐和声音的效果。对这些极高的像素环境投入了许多细节和护理，才给了这个游戏一个优美的外观，并且还有智利作曲家Francisco Cerda创作的美妙乐曲作为它的配乐。这些元素真正地使得詹姆斯敦从现今市场上的其他游戏中脱颖而出。

Overall, Jamestown is a ton of fun to play, especially with a couple of friends in co-op mode. The shop items and challenge packs add to the replay value, and the graphics and soundtrack enhance the experience of this classic shooter with a twist. Jamestown is available for $9.99 at http://www.finalformgames.com/jamestown/.
