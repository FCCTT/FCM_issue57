This top-down shooter takes what we all know and love from classic shooters and gives it a refresh - with imaginative storytelling and amazing graphics.

詹姆斯敦：失落殖民地的传说是首次亮相的淘汰赛最终游戏的形式。这种自上而下的射击手我们全都了解并且喜欢这个经典的射击游戏，给它一个刷新——就会有富有想象的故事和令人惊讶的图片。固体游戏是樱桃树的顶部，这使的最近的谦卑独立开发包拥有一个伟大的除了任何玩家的收集。

Jamestown takes place in the 17th century as the British battle for survival on colonial Mars. You begin your journey as an escaped convict from the Tower of London en route to the Lost Colony of Roanoke. Your mission is to clear your name by way of heroic deeds, which leads you to the Eastern Frontier - where John Smith helps to defend the colony from the allied Spanish/Martian troops.

詹姆斯敦成立于17世纪的英国战争为了殖民火星人民的生存。开始你的旅行作为一个来自伦敦塔的逃犯，路线是到达殖民地的罗诺克。你的使命是消除你的名字通过英雄的事迹，这将引导你去东部的边境,在那儿John Smith帮助保卫殖民地联盟来自西班牙/火星部队。

There are four ships available - Beam, Gunner, Charge, and Bomber. Your first ship is the basic, yet still capable, Beam. On the keyboard, Z is the main attack and X is the special attack. In this case, a beam can quickly eliminate larger and stronger enemies compared to the standard Z attack. Enemies that are killed drop gold coins - which help fill your vaunt meter, which activates a shield for a short period of time and is quite helpful when there is an incoming barrage of enemies. The vaunt, which is activated by pressing the space bar, also gives you a bonus that boosts that level's star rating.

在这儿可以得到四艘船——Beam,Gunner,Charge和Bomber。你的第一艘船是最基础的，但是有能力，Beam.在键盘上，Z代表主攻，X代表特殊攻击，在这种情况下，相对于Z的攻击一个Beam可以很快消灭更大更强的敌人。那些被杀死的敌人会掉下金币，这将帮助填满你的虚荣心 ，可以将盾牌激活一段很短的时间并且对敌人用电进攻时很有帮助。夸大，可以用空格键激活，给你的奖金可以增加你的星级等级。

After completing a level, there is an in-depth breakdown of your performance such as enemies destroyed and highest combo. After a few stages of battle, you can head to the shop and spend that hard earned gold to unlock items like ships, challenge packs, and various game modes.Overall, the controls and gameplay are very solid and smooth; there were no noticeable glitches or bugs, and the controls were comfortable on both mouse and keyboard.

完成任务的水平，有一个在你表现方面深入的突破，例如敌人的摧毁和最高的联合物。经过几个阶段的战争后，你可以直接到商店，花费努力赚来的黄金解锁项目，如船，挑战包和各种游戏模型.总体上，监控和游戏都非常坚实并且光滑，没有显而易见的小故障或错误，控制鼠标和键盘之间的控制是舒服的。

The graphics and soundtrack are an integral part of most games, but Final Form did an impeccable job with the quality of the stage design, music, and sound effects. The detail and care put into the lush pixel environments give it a polished look, and Chilean composer Francisco Cerda created a beautiful soundtrack to complement it. These elements are what really set Jamestown apart from other top-down shooters on the market today.

其中图片和声音的积分占整个游戏的一大部分，但是最终的形式是一个无懈可击的工作包括舞台设计的质量，音乐和声音的效果。这些细节和喜好放进丰富的像素环境，给它一个优美的外表，智利作曲家Francisco Cerda创作了一首美妙的乐曲作为它的配乐.这些元素是真正建立詹姆斯敦今天的市场，除了其他自上而下的射手。

Overall, Jamestown is a ton of fun to play, especially with a couple of friends in co-op mode. The shop items and challenge packs add to the replay value, and the graphics and soundtrack enhance the experience of this classic shooter with a twist. Jamestown is available for $9.99 at http://www.finalformgames.com/jamestown/.
